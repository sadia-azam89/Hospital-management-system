# Hospital-management-system
The given code is an implementation of a patient and room management system using a linked list data structure. The code defines two classes: patient and room.

The Patient class represents a patient and contains the nested structure patient_node, which represents a node in the patient linked list. The class provides methods for inserting, deleting, searching, updating, and traversing patient records.
The Room class represents a room and contains the nested structure room_node, which represents a node in the room linked list. The class provides methods for inserting and traversing room records.

**Here's an overview of the methods available in the Patient class:**
emptyList(): Checks if the patient linked list is empty.
insert_end_pateint(): Inserts a new patient record at the end of the patient linked list.
delete_record(): Deletes a patient record with a given ID.
insert(): Inserts a new patient record in a sorted order based on the ID.
traverse_pateint(): Traverses and displays all patient records.
search(): Searches for a patient record with a given ID.
update(): Updates the room number and ward number of a patient record.

**And here's an overview of the methods available in the Room class:**
empty(): Checks if the room linked list is empty.
insert_end_room(): Inserts a new room record at the end of the room linked list.
traverse_room(): Traverses and displays all room records.
searchRoom(): Searches for a room record with a given room number.
